The ICS Registration Committee is one of the standing committees of ICS (standing committee means a committee ‘with a continued existence, formed to do its assigned work on an ongoing basis’). Some of their tasks include preparation for teaching load assignments for a semester, handling registration issues (e.g., assignment of registration advisers, SP/Thesis advisers) and checking the status of students, primarily BS level students (we have MS/MIT and PhD students).
